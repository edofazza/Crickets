An important issue related to agriculture and animals is to decode their behaviors so as to make predictions about the state of the land and the environment. Some deep learning-based solutions have been carried out to be able to relate animal behavior to environmental changes, (Couzin & Heins, 2022) argue that such study has great potential and is rich in opportunities to understand how animal behavior plays a central role in ecological processes. The problem of studying animal behavior is related to encoding their language, several strategies have been used, and recently strategies based on pose estimation (Mathis, Mamidanna, Cury et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2022) have favored the possibility of tracking movements and estimating behaviors (Hayden, Park, & Zimmermann, 2022; Fang et al. 2021). However, the estimated behaviors merely define what the animal is doing without any correlation with what is going on around it; as for interaction with the outside world, techniques based on reading nerve stimuli are still used. For example, Saha et al. (2020) used locusts (Schistocerca americana) to study signals from olfactory receptor neurons in order to understand whether the smell of explosives was perceived and the amount of concentration, creating a kind of biosensor (Schott, Wehrenfenning, Gasch, & Vilcinskas, 2013). The goal of this paper is to do the same, i.e., to go and identify an external agent, using non-invasive techniques based on deep learning and exploiting the house cricket (Acheta Domestiche) as an animal by going to study the movement of its antennae. The choice to use this type of animal is related to the fact that a very common and readily available insect and in the literature the antennae of this insect have been defined, in addition to being long and threadlike, as important mechanosensory and chemosensory organs (Loudon, Bustamante, & W. Kellogg, 2014) and precisely because of this, their tracking has been considered as an attempt to investigate the interaction between these insects and objects that approach them (Honegger, 1981; Yamawaki & Ishibashi, 2013), but as of yet there are no studies using its antennae for odor recognition, as is the case, however, in other insects that are less visible, and therefore more difficult to do pose estimation on antennae, such as ants (Draft et al, 2018; Catania, 2013). In addition to these abilities, crickets are proven to be capable of excellent mnemonic abilities (Matsumoto & Mizunami, 2006), excellent learning abilities (Matsumoto, 2022; Matsumoto & Mizunami; 2004), and can be used as biocontrols against some insects by emitting ultrasonic waves, making them benefit from their presence in agricultural fields (Tito, 2017). The purpose of this study is to introduce a workflow based on artificial intelligence techniques that allows the identification of the type of interaction occurred within a petri dish between a cricket and a chemical agent. With this initial approach we intend to pave the way for the creation of intelligent biohybrid systems based on computer vision and sequence processing techniques that are fully autonomous, eco-friendly and sustainable in that they do not harm the environment by relying only on cameras.'
